# README #

My main focus with this navigation is to be able to control and customize most aspects through SASS variables for quick implementation and deployment while avoiding the cookie cutter look.

There are three parts to this navigation: css (_navigation.scss + _media-queries.scss), js (main.js), & the html markup in index.html. The rest of the files are for layout purposes only and are not necessary for the navigation to work properly. You should be able to control most aspects of the navigation through the variables in _navigation.scss. SASS and jQuery are the only two dependencies. 

I will provide further documentation if there's a demand for it. Enjoy!
